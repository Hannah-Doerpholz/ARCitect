If you want to create, edit, or extend an ARC, this is the tool to use.

ARCitect offers the following ways to open an ARC:
  
    * Create a brand new ARC on your local computer.
    * Open an ARC on your computer.
    * Browse and import an cloud stored ARC.

Once opened, it is possible to navigate through your ARC much like a file browser and perform the following functions

    * Add data or other files
    * Edit text documents
    * Add or modify metadata. 

After completing the adjustments, the following options are available:  

    * Save ARC locally  
    * Upload the ARC to a DataHUB  
    * Synchronize local changes with the cloud-stored
